<h4>TL;DR: using reserve() saves 65% of the time versus using dynamic allocation</h4>
<p>We all know about the <code>vector::reserve(size_type n)</code> method.  However, I personally had no
idea how much of a factor it would save in actual performance.  I wanted to test it out and figure out exactly how much time could be saved by using this method.</p>
<p>
I have written tests which test performance of the vector container 
under 3 scenarios:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Not reserving any memory.</li>
    <li>Reserving all the memory needed.</li>
    <li>Reserving just over half of the memory needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The results from the analysis resulted in bi-normal distributions for
each of the scenarios.  However, it is clearly visible that using reserve
frees up 65% of the processing time vs using vector without reserving.  There is even a considerable difference between the half-reserve and full reserve, implying that most of our performance
loss is happening due to copying larger and larger amounts of data.</p>
