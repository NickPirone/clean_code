<h4>TL;DR: using reserve() saves 65% of the time versus using dynamic allocation</h4>
<p>Today, I am writing about reserving space for elements when using
std::vector. I am using this method to reserve space for elements: </p>
<pre><code>vector::reserve(size_type n)</code></pre>
<p>
I have written tests which test performance of the vector container 
under 3 scenarios:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Not reserving any memory.</li>
    <li>Reserving all the memory needed.</li>
    <li>Reserving just over half of the memory needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The results from the analysis resulted in bi-normal distributions for
each of the scenarios (if you have an idea on why and how to test for it,
please comment below!).  However, it is clearly visible that using reserve
frees up 65% of the processing time.  There is even a considerable difference
between the half-reserve and full reserve, showing that copying that many elements
will always cost a large amount of time.</p>
