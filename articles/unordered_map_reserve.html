<h4>TL;DR: using reserve() saves a small amount (~7%) of time with unordered_map.</h4>
<p>From my understanding, in most C++ compiler implementations of unordered_map, when the load factor <code>(size() / bucket_count())</code> gets above the <code>max_load_factor</code>, the container will try to double its bucket count and rehash its contents.  I have tested the pattern of bucket counts that arise when incrementally adding elements to an unordered_map, and the counts go from [0,2,5,11,23,...].  It seems like it doubles and then adds one to ensure that it is hitting a prime number (for easy rehashing).  I wanted to test whether reserving the number of buckets needed beforehand would help performance in any way.</p>
<p>
I performed the following four tests for a map that would end up storing 10K elements.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Not reserving any buckets.</li>
    <li>Reserving all the buckets needed.</li>
    <li>Reserving just over half of the buckets needed.</li>
    <li>Reserving just over a quarter of the buckets needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see from the results, using reserve will end up saving you some time.  However, it is not nearly as pronounced as the savings from my previous article on vector's reserve method.  I saw a gain of about 250 microseconds out of 3620 microsecond baseline.  The code used to generate this data can be found <a href=https://github.com/NickPirone/clean_code/blob/master/source/unordered_map_reserve.cpp>here</a>.
